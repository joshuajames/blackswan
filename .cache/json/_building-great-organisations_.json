Some of that meaning can come from working together, with a common purpose. But what we build together should also mean something, and resonate in some way, with the wider world — the external audience.</p>\n<p>Esko Kilpi talks about communication in terms of a series of gestures and responses. He also suggests that we should take this beyond our teams and organisation — to consider our product as a gesture, and that they generate a response from our customers. It&#8217;s more like a conversation with the world, with a constant back and forth, and it requires a new kind of organisation. A more socially-oriented organisation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jim Collins puts it <a href=\"http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/the-most-creative.html\">like this</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2025\" alt=\"good-to-great-jim-collins\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/blackswanfarming/images/f_auto,q_auto/w_600,h_351/v1613032193/W/good-to-great-jim-collins/good-to-great-jim-collins.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/blackswanfarming/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1613032193/W/good-to-great-jim-collins/good-to-great-jim-collins.jpg 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/blackswanfarming/images/f_auto,q_auto/w_300,h_175,c_scale/v1613032193/W/good-to-great-jim-collins/good-to-great-jim-collins-300x175.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" />&#8220;The next wave of enduring great companies will be built not by technical or product visionaries, but by social visionaries — those who see their company and how it operates as their ultimate creation, and who invent entirely new ways of organizing human effort and creativity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is a new paradigm in town – one where value is created by tapping into our most human needs – to be social, have fun, and create together. We create value through our ingenuity: the quality of being clever, original and inventive. Even the word &#8220;ingenuity&#8221; is about what is inside us: it comes from the Latin <em>ingenuus</em>, which means &#8216;inborn&#8217;. It is in us – we just have to bring it out – and it is the role of the organisations that we build to create the atmosphere and environment that nutures our innate human potential.</p>\n","title":"Building great organisations","date":"April 29, 2013","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='234'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20234'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M0%20117v117h401V0H282a1721%201721%200%2000-119%201L81%200H0v117M251%2016c-11%204-11%205-6%206h8a21771%2021771%200%200059%2013c5%201%206%201%209-1l4-1-3-1a4076%204076%200%2000-54-16c3-1%202-2-4-2-4-1-6%200-13%202m-26%2010c-3%200-5%201-5%202-1%201%2058%2025%2061%2025l4-2%203-1-3-2-6-3-4-1%203-2c3-2%204-2%2013%200s9%202%2013%201l3-3a860%20860%200%2000-82-14m-36%2012l-12%203-2%201%202%201c2%202%2060%2022%2065%2024%205%201%207%201%2023-7%207-3%207-3%200-5-5-1-6-1-13%202l-7%203-11-4c-12-4-12-4-6-6%205-1%204-2-1-4-3-1-5-1-10%201l-6%201-9-3-8-2%207-3c8-3%208-3%203-5-5-1-3-1-15%203m-37%2011c-7%200-28%205-27%206l57%2026%2015%206%205-2%205-3a335%20335%200%2000-28-14c1-1%208%201%2022%205l21%205%205-2%204-3-21-6c-18-4-20-5-21-7-2-6-23-12-37-11m-4%206c-3%201-3%201%2012%207%206%202%2013%202%2013-1%200-4-18-8-25-6m-62%209c-15%203-21%2010-14%2016%203%204%2040%2024%2046%2026%2016%206%2045%200%2045-9%200-3%200-3%205-2h8l2-2-10-4-30-14-21%207%203%203c5%202%205%202%209%201l5-2%206%203c10%206%2011%207%206%209-7%204-13%203-35-9-26-14-28-15-19-18%204-1%209-1%2018%203%203%201%2016-1%2016-3l-15-6c-6-1-17-1-25%201'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":1.7123287671232876,"src":"/static/8f9bfc87d0861979e92d58bdddde41db/c3638/good-to-great-jim-collins.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8f9bfc87d0861979e92d58bdddde41db/84d81/good-to-great-jim-collins.jpg 250w,\n/static/8f9bfc87d0861979e92d58bdddde41db/f0719/good-to-great-jim-collins.jpg 500w,\n/static/8f9bfc87d0861979e92d58bdddde41db/c3638/good-to-great-jim-collins.jpg 600w","sizes":"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/black-swan-farming-using-cost-of-delay/","title":"Black Swan Farming using Cost of Delay"},"next":{"uri":"/when-to-launch-a-change-initiative/","title":"When to launch a change initiative"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMDEz","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoxMDQw","nextPostId":"cG9zdDo5Mjk="}}
