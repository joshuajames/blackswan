It&#8217;s possible that the feedback came in too large a batch, so maybe I can break it down and suggest some incremental improvements. I&#8217;ll start with the part I struggle with the most and see if we can make it just a <em>little</em> bit better&#8230;</p>\n<h3>The SAFe &#8220;Cost of Delay&#8221; formula today</h3>\n<p>Here is SAFe&#8217;s formula for Cost of Delay, as it is today on the website:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Cost of Delay</strong> = User-Business Value <strong>+</strong> Time Criticality <strong>+</strong> Risk Reduction and/or Opportunity Enablement</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of my <a href=\"http://blackswanfarming.com/safe-and-weighted-shortest-job-first-wsjf/\">main challenges</a> with this definition is that it <u>adds</u> &#8216;Time Criticality&#8221; to the other two parameters. To see why this doesn&#8217;t make sense, consider an option for which the &#8220;User-Business Value&#8221; = 0 and &#8220;Risk Reduction and/or Opportunity Enablement&#8221; = 0 but for which &#8220;Time Criticality&#8221; = 21.</p>\n<p>In this case, SAFe is suggesting that</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Cost of Delay</strong> = 0 + 0 + 21 = <strong>21</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This result clearly shows that there is a problem with the formula. If an option has zero <i>value</i>, then it shouldn&#8217;t matter how <i>time critical</i> it is, the Cost of Delay should be zero.</p>\n<p>It has since been explained to me that SAFe practitioners do indeed recognise this as a problem. To cater for this, there is some sort of &#8220;strategy filter&#8221; which weeds out these sort of nonsense results. In effect, they put a lower bound of 1 on each of the components.</p>\n<p><strong>The need for this filter highlights that the SAFe formula poorly reflects the underlying principles of Cost of Delay. The filter doesn&#8217;t fix the problem though, it merely hides the most obviously flawed results.</strong></p>\n<p>What follows is a proposal for making a small, simple and hopefully as painless an improvement as I can think of. Assuming we can <em>only</em> use the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">same three qualitative inputs</span>, how might we improve this?</p>\n<h3>Value</h3>\n<p>The current SAFe formula has two terms which are both about Value (&#8220;User-Business Value&#8221;, and &#8220;Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement&#8221;. Depending on the sub-type, these map perfectly well to the <a href=\"http://blackswanfarming.com/understanding-value/\">four buckets of value</a> that I normally use, which (when they are all denominated in the same scale or currency) we can combine into total <i>Value </i>like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Value = Increase Revenue + Protect Revenue + Reduce Cost + Avoid Cost</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the same way, we can continue to add UBV and RROE together, like so:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Value = User or Business Value + Risk Reduction and/or Opportunity Enablement</p></blockquote>\n<p>Quick sanity check: either one of these can be zero, but if <em>both</em> are zero, then value (and subsequently, Cost of Delay) should also be zero. So far, so good – and no change yet, so this should be easy to swallow.</p>\n<h3>Combining with Urgency</h3>\n<p>The main issue lies in how we treat the parameter that SAFe calls &#8220;Time Criticality&#8221;. I usually call this &#8220;Urgency&#8221; and ask people to consider which of the <a href=\"http://blackswanfarming.com/urgency-profiles/\">four most common Urgency Profiles</a> that a value proposition can have. This helps them do a better job of estimating what the impact of time is on the outcome you&#8217;re interested in. The result is Cost of Delay, for which the units are $/week or £/month.</p>\n<p>As we&#8217;ve already said though, we cannot simply add &#8220;Time Criticality&#8221; to the other two value terms. Urgency is <em>orthogonal</em> to Value. I&#8217;ve also tried to make the case previously that <a href=\"http://blackswanfarming.com/managing-queues-product-development/\">urgency alone is not enough</a>, you need both. Urgency is the part that turns a feature for which the value is estimated to be worth, say, $2m into a feature for which the Cost of Delay is $10,000/week. The same feature with a <em>different urgency</em> could have a Cost of Delay of $20,000/week, or as low as $0/week.  For those allergic to numbers, I already proposed a simplified <a href=\"http://blackswanfarming.com/qualitative-cost-delay/\">qualitative Urgency</a>. In this simplified model I proposed that Urgency is, in effect, <i>multiplied</i> by Value to get Cost of Delay.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Cost of Delay = Value x Urgency</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Applying the same underlying principles to the SAFe formula give us:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Cost of Delay = (User or Business Value + Risk Reduction and/or Opportunity Enablement) x (Time Criticality)</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>If you have read this post about <a href=\"http://blackswanfarming.com/qualitative-cost-delay/\">Qualitative Cost of Delay</a> you should be able to see how these two align. In this case, you&#8217;re adding together two terms (U-BV and RR/OE) as Value on the vertical axis, with &#8220;Time Criticality&#8221; in place of Urgency on the horizontal axis.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3986\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/blackswanfarming/images/f_auto,q_auto/w_638,h_477/v1613421622/W/Cost-of-Delay-9-box-Qualitative-per-week/Cost-of-Delay-9-box-Qualitative-per-week.png\" alt=\"Cost of Delay 9-box Qualitative per week\" width=\"638\" height=\"477\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/blackswanfarming/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1613421622/W/Cost-of-Delay-9-box-Qualitative-per-week/Cost-of-Delay-9-box-Qualitative-per-week.png 638w, https://res.cloudinary.com/blackswanfarming/images/f_auto,q_auto/w_300,h_224,c_scale/v1613421622/W/Cost-of-Delay-9-box-Qualitative-per-week/Cost-of-Delay-9-box-Qualitative-per-week-300x224.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/blackswanfarming/images/f_auto,q_auto/w_100,h_75,c_scale/v1613421622/W/Cost-of-Delay-9-box-Qualitative-per-week/Cost-of-Delay-9-box-Qualitative-per-week-100x75.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" /></p>\n<p>This approach also means that practitioners who aren&#8217;t <em>yet</em> ready to try quantifying Cost of Delay can use a simple matrix for visualising Value x Urgency as above. Feel free to use SAFe terminology, or whatever words resonate and make sense in your context. It&#8217;s the meaning that matters.</p>\n<p>Making this simple change would immediately put SAFe in a better position than the more common Value over Effort approach to prioritisation, which fails to account for urgency.</p>\n<h3>Going further&#8230;</h3>\n<p>The aim was to improve the approach using the same three qualitative parameters. If those constraints were relaxed, we could go further. Of course, there will always be a continuum in the way people approach and start using Cost of Delay. (I am an Engineer, not a &#8220;purist&#8221;, and I am far more interested in the successful <i>application</i> of sound theory than religious adherence to an impractical theory.)</p>\n<p>At least the underlying principles are now better reflected in the building blocks.</p>\n","title":"SAFe & Cost of Delay: a suggested improvement","date":"June 28, 2016","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='298'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20298'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M39%2019c-2%205-1%2016%203%2016l3%202%203%201v-9l-1-11c-2-2-7-1-8%201m148-1v9l1%208h3c2%200%204%200%205-2V18h-9M87%2090v26h80V65H87v25m82%201v25h80V65h-80v26m82%200v25h81V65h-81v26M45%20120c-2%203-2%205%200%203%201-1%201%204%201%2049a498%20498%200%20003-52c-2-4-2-4-4%200m42%2024v26h80v-52H87v26m82%200v26h80v-52h-80v26m82%200v26h81v-52h-81v26m-82%2054v25h80v-51h-80v26m82%200v25h81v-51h-81v26m10%2061c1%202-9%202-87%202a1463%201463%200%200090%204c4-2%204-3%200-5l-3-1M18%20286c0%205%200%205%203%205l3-1h6c1%202%204%200%204-2s-2-3-2%200c-1%201-1%200-1-2%200-3%200-3%201-2%201%202%202%201%202-2-2-3-5-1-6%203%200%202-1%203-1%201%200-6-2-7-4-1l-2%204-1-4-1-4-1%205'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":1.3440860215053763,"src":"/static/64e8c16b6e6cd3cfcc80b7a3b8fd79ce/2e547/Cost-of-Delay-9-Box-Value-and-Urgency.png","srcSet":"/static/64e8c16b6e6cd3cfcc80b7a3b8fd79ce/002c1/Cost-of-Delay-9-Box-Value-and-Urgency.png 250w,\n/static/64e8c16b6e6cd3cfcc80b7a3b8fd79ce/53f65/Cost-of-Delay-9-Box-Value-and-Urgency.png 500w,\n/static/64e8c16b6e6cd3cfcc80b7a3b8fd79ce/2e547/Cost-of-Delay-9-Box-Value-and-Urgency.png 556w","sizes":"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px"}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/fund-the-teams-not-the-project/","title":"Fund the teams, not the project"},"next":{"uri":"/agile2016/","title":"#Agile2016"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo0MTMx","previousPostId":"cG9zdDo0MTU4","nextPostId":"cG9zdDo0MTIy"}}
