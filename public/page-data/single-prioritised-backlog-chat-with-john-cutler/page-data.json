Tiny even.<br />\nAnd: some of the most valuable things <em>don’t</em> come from Strategy.</p>\n<h3>What alternative is there, that might work better?</h3>\n<p>How can we get clarity, focus, alignment without the unintended consequences that in some contexts surface? Well, I would recommend more of a combination of a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://blackswanfarming.com/four-steps-to-quantifying-cost-of-delay/\">Quantify the Cost of Delay</a> at the <em>Outcome</em> level, especially for strategic initiatives. (If you really can&#8217;t quantify the value and urgency of the outcome, maybe it&#8217;s not as urgent or valuable as you think?) Whether you present those in an &#8220;ordered list&#8221; or not doesn&#8217;t really matter, since you have no sense of what it takes to achieve those outcomes yet!</li>\n<li>Allow each team to figure out how they might <em>contribute</em> toward one or more of those high-level outcomes. This might be a set of features, small experiments, stories or small changes. Product Manager and team together figure out a rough idea of what the % contribution for each of those might be. You could use this <a href=\"http://blackswanfarming.com/qualitative-cost-delay/\">Qualitative Cost of Delay</a> approach for this, but I&#8217;d still recommend you tie it back to a rough % contribution of the Outcome – that way you have the numerator of CD3.</li>\n<li>Have the teams do a rough T-shirt size or relative estimate of how long each of the the various options is likely to block the pipeline for. If they&#8217;re all roughly the same size then doing this step doesn&#8217;t harm anything! Take the Cost of Delay % and divide by the duration and you have a CD3 ranking that makes sense at the local level, but is still clearly connected to the higher-level Outcomes and their Cost of Delay.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Using this approach, each team can be focused on their own CD3-ranked outcomes that suits their skills and capabilities. If there&#8217;s tonnes of dependencies, then try to break those where possible, or at least surface them as part of a regular (say quarterly) lookahead, where you get all the teams in a room together AKA, Big Room Planning.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s still an important role for the Product Manager to ensure alignment across the org, but the crux of this approach is that you are transmitting the information to make better decisions at the level where those tradeoffs and prioritisation decisions are actually being made, day in day out.</p>\n<p>As for mixing in the Technical Debt prioritisation decisions, at the end of the day, I&#8217;d leave that up to the team, with appropriate monitoring and visualisation of problems as they arise.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">In my view, Tech Debt prioritisation decisions are best made *locally*, not globally. But as we discussed, I’d make problems in that area (as with poor org design) visible.</p>\n<p>— Joshua J. Arnold (@joshuajames) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshuajames/status/1011844735680446464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 27, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Ultimately, technical debt tends to manifest as elongating cycletimes. Shortening cycletimes and in particular speeding the speed and SNR of various nested feedback loops should be something that every team is looking after. (This is what I was droning on about when we started talking about retrospectives, and giving teams clear direction around three principles and related measures that <em>they own</em> as a team.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Three principles:<br />\n1.
